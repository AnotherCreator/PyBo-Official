Pybo (paɪ boʊ) is a [Discord](https://discord.com/brand-new) bot that utilizes the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) 
API wrapper to run the bot. Pybo also integrates the [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/) to track and display the top 100 cryptocurrencies.

#### Quick Disclaimer:
The current version of Pybo (DevBo) being hosted here on Github will usually be the latest / stable version of the bot 
available. I am currently running two separate instances of the bot, one locally (DevBo | Github) and one in the cloud (PyBo | Heroku). 
If you choose to invite the **official** PyBo hosted on the cloud, please be aware that there might still be some issues 
as I am continually exploring *Heroku* and *PostgreSQL*.
